        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            I’m a dual Ph.D. student in Astrophysics and Astrobiology at UW, applying machine learning and statistical modeling to explore cosmic mysteries—from dark matter using stellar streams to asteroid detection and binary star identification in large datasets. With a foundation from a dual B.S. in Astrophysics and Geophysics at UCLA, I have honed expertise in time-series analysis, convolutional neural networks, and simulation-based inference with normalizing flows. My leadership roles, including President of UCLA’s Astronomical Society, sharpened my team and communication skills. Beyond research, I’m a passionate astrophotographer and traveler, driven to push the boundaries of astrophysics and data science.

            My research focuses on applying machine learning to uncover the universe’s mysteries, spanning topics from solar system science to cosmology. Currently, I am investigating the mysterious properties of dark matter using stellar streams and simulation-based inference (SBI) with normalizing flows. My previous projects include developing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect faint asteroids for planetary defense and searching for missing populations of binary star systems (cataclysmic variables) with short orbital periods in massive datasets. Through projects with the Zwicky Transient Facility and the upcoming Rubin Observatory, I am continuously refining my skills in time-series analysis, deep learning, and pattern recognition.

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            Beyond research, I have served in leadership roles within academic societies, including as President of The Astronomical Society at UCLA and The Society of Sigma Gamma Epsilon. These experiences have strengthened my ability to lead teams, communicate complex concepts to diverse audiences, and foster collaborative environments.

        <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            I am passionate about pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the universe while exploring the intersections of astrophysics, machine learning, and data science. Outside of research, I am an avid astrophotographer and traveler, always seeking fresh perspectives and inspiration.
        </p>
        
        <p style="text-indent: 2em; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            With a robust foundation in astrophysics, machine learning, and data science, I am eager to apply my skills toward solving complex problems and contributing to groundbreaking discoveries in astronomy.
